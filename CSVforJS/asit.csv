ASIt accounts for minimally different variants within a sample of closely related languages- thus it does not need a thorough part of speech (POS) disambiguation- since the ""trivial"" identification of basic POS (e.g. Nouns vs Verbs) is not enough to capture cross-linguistic differences between closely related languages. Secondly- the linguistic variants cannot be reduced to lexical distinctions only- i.e. syntactic differences are in general unpredictable on the basis of the properties of single lexical items. A specific tag set designed to capture sentence-level phenomena without taking into consideration POS tags is needed. As a consequence- while other tag sets are designed to carry out a gross linguistic analysis of a vast corpus- the ASIt tag set aims to capture fine-grained grammatical differences by comparing various dialectal translations of the same sentence. Moreover- in order to pin down these subtle asymmetries- the linguistic analysis must be carried out manually.To explain why the needs for ASIt are so special we have to take into consideration two different aspects: the nature of Italian dialects- and the kind of linguistic theory ASIt aims to interact with. The Italian dialectal area presents a kind of variation that involves parametric choices affecting many general aspects of syntax- morphology- and phonology. The kind of information we want to gather involves not only the presence of a certain element- but also the absence of an element; an element can be omitted only in some constructions and in conjunction with specific characteristics of the language. For this reason- ASIt proposed the creation of a specific set of tags starting from a universal core shared by all languages (on the basis of the work done by DynaSAND)- and subsequently developing a language-specific periphery which is compatible with other projects.Dialectal data stored in the ASIt were gathered during a twenty-year-long survey investigating the distribution of several grammatical phenomena across the dialects of Italy. These data and information were collected by means of questionnaires formed by sets of Italian sentences: dialectal speakers were asked to translate them into their dialects and write their translations in the questionnaire; therefore- each questionnaire is associated with many parallel dialectal translations. At present- there are eight different questionnaires written in Italian and almost 500 questionnaires- corresponding to the eight Italian questionnaires- written in more than 240 different dialects- for a total of more than 54-000 sentences and more than 40-000 tags stored in the data resource managed by the ASIt digital library system.",http://purl.org/asit/alld,False,0.75,1,0,0.001,-,420000,asit,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,8.131134216857658e-05,endpoint absent,Name: Gianmaria Silvello; Email:None,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://purl.org/asit/alld Name:Gianmaria Silvello Email:silvello@dei.unipd.it,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0.00,130,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.387,0.1,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent
