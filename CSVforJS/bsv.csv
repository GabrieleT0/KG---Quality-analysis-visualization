2022-07-18,1,0,Creative Commons Attribution - cc-by -,False,French Plant Health Bulletins,Plant Health Bulletins (PHB) are named Bulletins de Santé du Végétal (BSV) in french. This dataset is an open archive of PHB published after 2009.The dataset is one result of the french project untitled VESPA (Value and optimization of epidemiosurveillance devices in a sustainable crop protection strategy) leading by INRA.A PHB is an information document- both technical and regulatory in nature- written under the responsibility of a regional epidemiological surveillance committee. A PHB gathers information about the health status of crops. It first presents pest risk analysis- and it is also used to disseminate regulatory information (mandatory control order- national notes- regulation evolution- etc.) and non-regulatory information (description of pest biology or prophylactic methods- such as management of intercropping- tillage- choice of cultivars- etc.).To access PHB a french thesaurus has been developed called FrenchCropUsage. This is a thesaurus of types of crops- organized according to their destination (direct human food- animal feed- food industry- etc) and the type of culture system (field crop- market gardening- etc.). This thesaurus represents the French point of view.
