2022-07-18,-1,0,Creative Commons Attribution - cc-by -,-,Relations for Reusing (R4R) Ontology,R4R is a light-weight ontology for representing general relationships of resource for publication and reusing. It asserts that a certain reusing context occurred and determined by its two basic relations- namely- isPackagedWith and isCitedBy. The isPackagedWith relation declares the resource is ready to be reused by incorporating License and Provenance information. The cites relation is an exceptional to isCitedBy which occurs only two related objects cite each other at the same time. Five resource objects including article- data- code- provenance and license are major class concepts to represent in this ontology. ,http://guava.iis.sinica.edu.tw/r4r,absent,0.75,[],{},nan,-,0,r4r,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,endpoint absent,Name: Institute of Information Science; Academia Sinica; Email:andreahg@iis.sinica.edu.tw,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://guava.iis.sinica.edu.tw/r4r Name:Andrea Wei-Ching Huang and Tyng-Ruey Chuang Email:andreahg@iis.sinica.edu.tw,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0,0,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.337,44.74,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent
