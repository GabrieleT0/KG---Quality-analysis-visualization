There are many AudioScrobbler clients for a wide range of media players. It now also provides you with the list of your friends (using their URI on this service- allowing to access their friends and scrobbles).This representations is designed using the Music Ontology- FOAF and a small AudioScrobble ontology. Moreover- it is interlinked with corresponding dereferencable URIs in the Musicbrainz repository (see this quick explanation of why this is important).### StatisticsThe triple count and MusicBrainz link count are based on estimates of total user numbers.,http://dbtune.org/last-fm/,False,0.75,1,0,0.001,-,600000000,dbtuneaudioscrobbler,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,0.0006795181545746704,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://dbtune.org/last-fm/ Name:Yves Raimond Email:yves@dbtune.org,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0.03,15000000,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,True,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.339,44.74,-,-,endpoint absent
