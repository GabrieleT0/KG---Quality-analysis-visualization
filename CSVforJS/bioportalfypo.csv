FYPO is being developed to support the comprehensive and detailed representation of phenotypes in PomBase- the new online fission yeast resource (www.pombaes.org). Its scope is similar to that of the Ascomycete Phenotype Ontology (APO)- but FYPO includes more detailed pre-composed terms as well as computable definitions.,http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1689,True,1.0,10,0.778,0.005,-,33885,bioportalfypo,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,9.614019964148878e-05,endpoint absent,Name: BioPortal project on behalf of ontology owner.; Email:support@bioontology.org,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1689 Name:Midoria Harris Email:Absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0.03,1010,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.351,44.74,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent
